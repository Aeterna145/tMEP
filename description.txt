tMEP: The Terraria Modded Expansion Project
===========================================
(Scroll to bottom for version notes for those interested in simply testing the mod)

Welcome to a new start, Terrarian.

The Terraria Modded Expansion Project is a mod designated to expand Terraria past its limits.
Over the course of many updates and additions, we will be transforming Terraria from what it is currently to a more "MMO" style game along the veins of Destiny, World of Warcraft, and others.
From lore, to raids, to multiplayer activities, to factions and so much more. Terraria will never be the same.

As of late, the current release you are viewing right now will be a stable testing beta for the concept, as well as a general test of features and garnering of community feedback.
Nothing here will be finalized until the release of "A Terrarian's Dawn", coming sometime either December 2021 or Summer 2022

HOW THIS WORKS:
=============
tMEP will be updated consistently with a variety of releases and fixes.
How tMEP updates and what it adds will be divulged in the version notes in this description, and on the Discord's update blog.

There are 4 kinds of updates:
-Major Content Updates (Expansion Releases): Expansions are released as major content updates. We currently have a few planned and a few still in development.
-Minor Content Updates (Raid Releases, Seasonal Content): Smaller content releases, such as raids, are released separately while we bug test them for the first week of a major content update.
-Patches (Bug fixes, balancing changes, etc.): These are mainly to fix up the game, change around balancing, and make the mod an overall enjoyable experience.
-Hotfixes: Immediate changes and updates made to the mod in order to swiftly fix anything game breaking.

SCHEDULE:
=============
The current release schedule is undetermined, given that college and work have my hands tied. However, this doesn't mean I'm not working behind the scenes.
