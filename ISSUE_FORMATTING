Issue Formatting In A Shellnut:
===============================
I've boiled this down to a simple format:

TITLE: 
[IDENTIFIER TAG]: Issue Title
BODY:
Issue (Expanded):
Notes:

The ID Tag is a way of knowing what an issue is and what its status is.
The Issue Title is obvious.
Issue (Expanded) refers to explaining your issue more so we get the full picture.
Notes is any additional information, such as what caused the issue, proposed fixes, etc.

There are various different flairs:
[Type / Severity]
Types:
K = Known Issue: Previously seen issue that has either been noticed by developers or is simply a running issue.
G(S) = Glitch (Soft): A "soft" glitch is a glitch that is relatively small and not a high priority to fix.
G(H) = Glitch (Hard): A "hard" glitch is a glitch that should be investigated immediately due to severity.
B = Bug Issue: Some form of bug, varies in severity.
SL = Soft Lock: Unintentional soft locks that prevent progression or player usage of the mod.
C = Crash: Crash errors caused by the mod that should be looked into immediately.
CO = Compatibility: Compatibility errors that cause one or more mods to not function properly (or at all) while tMEP is active.

Severities:
DB = Don't Bother: An issue so insignificant it really isn't worth looking into.
MI = Minor Inconvenience: Something that, while annoying, isn't of immediate concern but worth mentioning.
RP = Recurring Problem: Massively reported issue that should be looked into immediately.
GC = Growing Concern: Something that should likely be looked into soon.
GB = Game Breaking: Something that breaks the game entirely, should be looked into without delay.
CB = Computer Bricking: Something that can literally destroy a PC (this severity will likely never be used)

DEVELOPER ONLY SEVERITIES:
INV = Investigating: Currently looking into a developer-posted issue.
F = Fixed: Reached a possible fix for the developer-posted issue that should be tested.
